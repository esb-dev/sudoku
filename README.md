Solving Sudoku puzzles
======================

The project contains a few examples for solving Sudoku puzzles

* norvig.py     
  Peter Norvig's algorithm in Python, see [Peter Norvig:
	Solving Every Sudoku Puzzle](http://norvig.com/sudoku.html)

* sudoku-joc	
  The brute force algorithm from Michael Fogus, Chris Houser:
	_The Joy of Clojure Second Edition_

* sudoku   
  A more or less na√Øve brute force algorithm

* sudoku-cl	    
  A Sudoku solver in core.logic, adapted from [The core.logic Wiki](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic/wiki/Examples)

There are two more examples as parts of their projects on my github
account:

* A Sudoku solver based on the Logic WorkBench (lwb), see <https://github.com/esb-dev/lwb>

* A Sudoku solver based on Kodkod in Clojure (kic), the ultrathin
	wrapper for the Kodkod constraint solver, see <https://github.com/esb-dev/kic>

Examples of puzzles, "stolen" from Peter Norvig, can be found in the
resources subfolder of the project:

* easy50.txt  
  50 easy puzzles

* top95.txt   
  95 hard puzzles

* hardest.txt   
  11 puzzles found by searching for the "hardest puzzles"

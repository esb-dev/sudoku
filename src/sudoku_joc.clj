; Remark:
; The algorithm calculates all possible solutions and flattens them.
; If the puzzle is ambiguous, the result is not one of the solutions,
; but the concatenation of all solutions.
; See the example 'ambiguous' below.

; Second remark:
; The algorithm does not stop if a solution is found. As a consequence
; it is very, very slow
